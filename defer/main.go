	//what are defer types in go?
	// In Go, there are no specific "defer types" as such, but the `defer` statement can be used with any function or method call.
	// The deferred function can be a regular function, a method, or an anonymous function (closure).
	// The key characteristics of deferred functions in Go are:
	// 1. **Function or Method Calls**: You can defer any function or method call, including those that take parameters and return values.
	// 2. **Anonymous Functions**: You can use anonymous functions (closures) with `defer`, allowing you to capture variables from the surrounding scope.
	// 3. **Parameters**: You can pass parameters to the deferred function, and it will capture the values of those parameters at the time of the defer statement.
	// 4. **Return Values**: Deferred functions can return values, but they do not affect the return values of the surrounding function.
	// 5. **Error Handling**: Deferred functions can be used to handle errors, but they should not be used to change the return value of the surrounding function.
	// 6. **Resource Management**: Deferred functions are commonly used for resource management, such as closing files, releasing locks, or cleaning up resources.
	// 7. **Execution Order**: Deferred functions are executed in the reverse order of their declaration, meaning the last deferred function declared is the first one executed.
	// 8. **Execution Timing**: Deferred functions are executed after the surrounding function returns, just before it returns to the caller.
	// 9. **Panic Recovery**: Deferred functions can be used to recover from panics, allowing you to handle errors gracefully.
	// 10. **Variable Capture**: Deferred functions capture the state of variables at the time of their declaration, not at the time of their execution.
	// 11. **Named Return Values**: Deferred functions can modify named return values, allowing you to change the return value of the surrounding function.
	// 12. **Pointer Parameters**: You can pass pointers to deferred functions, allowing them to modify the original variable.
	// 13. **Multiple Defer Statements**: You can have multiple `defer` statements in a function, and they will be executed in the reverse order of their declaration.
	// 14. **Defer in Loops**: Be cautious when using `defer` inside loops, as it can lead to unexpected behavior due to the deferred functions being executed after the loop completes.
	// 15. **Defer in Goroutines**: When using `defer` in goroutines, the deferred function will execute when the goroutine completes, not when the surrounding function returns.
	// 16. **Defer with Interfaces**: You can defer methods on interfaces, allowing you to call methods on interface types.
	// 17. **Defer with Structs**: You can defer methods on structs, allowing you to call methods on struct types.
	// 18. **Defer with Channels**: You can defer operations on channels, allowing you to perform actions on channels after the surrounding function returns.
	// 19. **Defer with Slices**: You can defer operations on slices, allowing you to perform actions on slices after the surrounding function returns.
	// 20. **Defer with Maps**: You can defer operations on maps, allowing you to perform actions on maps after the surrounding function returns.

	// Rule: When deferring a direct function call like defer fmt.Println(err), the arguments are evaluated immediately.
	// Rule: When deferring a function with parameters like defer func() { fmt.Println(err) }(), the arguments are evaluated at the time of execution.
	// Rule: Closures capture variables by reference, so they observe the latest value at the time of execution.
	// Rule: When deferring a closure with arguments, those arguments are evaluated immediately â€” even if the closure runs later.

	// This way, the deferred function can change the value of r, and the change will be reflected in the return value.
	// The deferred function modifies the value of r by dereferencing the pointer, allowing it to change the original variable.
	// This is a common pattern when you want to ensure that the deferred function can modify the return value.
	// Note: The deferred function runs after the surrounding function returns, so any changes made to r in the deferred function
	// will affect the return value of f3.
	// output will be 6 because the deferred function adds 5 to the original value of r (which is 1).
